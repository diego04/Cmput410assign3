Added background image for all of them with the filename ricepaper.png

Edited the pre css tag containing contextual information about the books
Links would be color black and will be blue when mouse hovers it
Added text shadows over h1 & h2
Paragraphs would be italics and justified . 
Paragraphs have indents and margin.
Overrode inline styles for images to make them smaller.

Part 2:

UGLY CSS:
I imitated the 3rd comic of http://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell
as stated by the requirements
The ugly imitated CSS can be seen under uglycss.css
I used both inline styling and external style sheets.
The html file is under the name deasis.html

AWESOME CSS:
The improved CSS website has these specifications:
I used BootStrap for my own website that I hosted at Amazon S3.
Also, I used inline styling when I'm not using bootstrap css classes.
This website was done recently for this assignment: www.kevindeasis.com
It is the file named kevindeasis.html

I also downloaded a free patter on www.subtlepatterns.com by carlos aguilar
