I took the liberty to host my website at Amazon S3
at Feb 18, 2015

www.kevindeasis.com


The screenshots are under the folder named screenshots.
Screen shots were taken from firefox.

Part1 (Updates):

The files are Les Miserables, Twelve Years A Slave, and Lincoln's Love Story
Added border for the Gutenberg book information and centered the text.
I only used one external style sheet as stated in the requirements.org
One external stylesheet for all the html files in different directories
Changed the documents to html5
Added background image for all of them with the filename ricepaper.png
Made images have maximum height and width to make them smaller and easier to read
Edited the pre css tag containing contextual information about the books
Links would be color black and will be blue when mouse hovers it
Added text shadows over h1 & h2
Paragraphs would be italics and justified . 
Paragraphs have indents and margin.
Overrode inline styles for images to make them smaller.
Themed paragraphs
Themed header tags
Themed images and images caption


Part 2:

UGLY CSS:
I imitated the 3rd comic of http://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell
as stated by the requirements
The ugly imitated CSS can be seen under uglycss.css
I used both inline styling and external style sheets.
The html file is under the name deasis.html

AWESOME CSS:
The improved CSS website has these specifications:
I used BootStrap for my own website that I hosted at Amazon S3.
Also, I used inline styling when I'm not using bootstrap css classes.
This website was done recently for this assignment: www.kevindeasis.com
It is the file named kevindeasis.html

I also downloaded a free patter on www.subtlepatterns.com by carlos aguilar
that file name is footer_lodyas and the image is footer_lodyas.png
